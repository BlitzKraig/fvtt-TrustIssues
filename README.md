Trust no-one... Notification for the paranoid GM if a player opens devtools.

Always remember: Just because a player has their devtools open doesn't _necessarily_ mean they're cheating... üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Manifest

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BlitzKraig/fvtt-TrustIssues/master/module.json`

## Known Issues & Limitations

TrustIssues can only detect the console is open when the player mouses back over the canvas.

There are multiple ways a player could circumvent this detection. Cheaters always cheat.

## Feedback

This module is open for feedback and suggestions! I would love to improve it and implement new features.

For bugs/feedback, create an issue on GitHub, or contact me on Discord at Blitz#6797
